Installing
You can clone this repository using git:

Usage
You can run the main.py file to retrieve and analyze stock data. The script uses the yfinance package to retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance.

You can customize the script by modifying the SYMBOL and PERIOD variables in the main.py file. The SYMBOL variable specifies the stock symbol you want to analyze, and the PERIOD variable specifies the time period for which you want to retrieve the data.
